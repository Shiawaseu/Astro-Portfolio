### For every step here, insert all the information to your environment variables (check [here](/.env.example))

1 - Collect your Spotify Data
- https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create ![](/assets/spotify1.png) ![](/assets/spotify2.png)
  - Select "Web API" and make sure the redirect URI is your site (I.E: `https://mysite.com/api/spotify`) **You CAN provide a localhost and finish authentication in a development environment**
- Collect the **Client ID** & **Client Secret** ![](/assets/spotify3.png)

2 - Collect your Redis data (used for storing your access tokens along with refresh tokens)
- Create a new cache like so: ![](/assets/redis1.png)
  - Select `cache` & the rest is up to you

- Get your `host` / `port` / `password` from the dashboard: ![](/assets/redis2.png) ![](/assets/redis3.png)

3 - Authenticate your Spotify account
> At this point, you need your server running, whether it is locally or in production, make sure your redirect URI is matching in both the Spotify Dashboard & your environment variables.

- Navigate to `/api/spotify`
  - You will be prompted to log in to Spotify and then asked for permission to authorize the app you've created, accept.

- Once you have been redirected back, edit your URL as follows: ![](/assets/auth1.png) ![](/assets/auth2.png)
  - Once you have done that, you should be ready to go.
