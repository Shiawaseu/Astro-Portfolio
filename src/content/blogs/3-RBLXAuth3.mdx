# Introduction

In this part of the guide, we will be setting up our script (front-end) for our whitelist system.
<br />
This does not need much of an introduction, it will also be relatively short compared to the previous section.

## Acknowledgements
- For the remaining of this guide, I will be using the term "script" to refer to the front-end of our whitelist system.
- Concerning the script-server connection, you will have to keep your local development server running for the script to properly work.
> | Some executors may **NOT** support connections to local servers, so you may have to use a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet. (You may want to ask your executor's development team for more information on this).
- When it comes to obfuscating your script, the service to use is entirely up to you. But I HEAVILY recommend using **<a href="https://lura.ph/" className="text-indigo-700">Luraph</a>** for obfuscation, as we are also going to be using some of it's macros in our script.
  - A good practice when writing scripts you plan on obfuscating is using the <a href="https://github.com/Luraph/macrosdk/blob/main/luraphsdk.lua" className="text-indigo-400">Luraph SDK</a> to avoid potential issues in the obfuscation process (for the reamining of the guide we assume the SDK has been used at the top-most level of the script).
- **The client is not secured yet** as we are writing the barebones of the whitelist system. We will be adding security measures in the next part of the guide.
## Setting up our environment

For the script, we will be relying on 1 main function, which is:
- <code className="text-red-600">request</code> | Could be located under an exploit-specific global or the `http` global table in your exploit.
 - With the majority of executors following the [UNC](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard), you shouldn't worry much about writing ternary statements to check for the function's existence.

As for parsing the server response, we will stick to using the `JSONDecode` method provided by the `HttpService` service.
<br />
To get started, create a new script in your <code className="text-yellow-600">src/client</code> directory, we will call it <code className="text-blue-600">client.luau</code>, then we can start writing the following:


### Local declarations:
We will declare the necessary variables and functions we will be using in our script.
```luau
-- The LPH_CRASH function is a macro provided by Luraph | You don't have to use it like me here.
local key = getgenv().whitelistKey or LPH_CRASH()
local HttpService = game:GetService("HttpService")
-- Feel free to add more functions as needed
local request = (http and http.request) or request or LPH_CRASH()
```

### Auth call:
We will be making a POST request to the server's whitelist endpoint, sending the key as the body of the request.
```luau
local response = request({
    Url = "http://localhost:3000/whitelist",
    Method = "POST", -- The POST method corresponds to the server's whitelist endpoint
    Body = HttpService:JSONEncode({
        whitelistkey = key
    }),
    Headers = {
        ["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
    }
})
```

### Parsing the response:
We will be parsing the response from the server, checking if the server is healthy (status code is 200), then parsing the body of the response.
```luau
if response.StatusCode == 200 then
    local body = HttpService:JSONDecode(response.Body)
    if body.valid then
        print("Whitelisted")
    else
        print("Not whitelisted")
        LPH_CRASH()
    end
else
    print("Server not responding")
    LPH_CRASH()
end
```

### Final result
Here is the final result of our script:
```luau
-- getgenv().whitelistKey = "myexamplekey"
local key = getgenv().whitelistKey or LPH_CRASH()
local HttpService = game:GetService("HttpService")
local request = (http and http.request) or request or LPH_CRASH()

local response = request({
    Url = "http://localhost:3000/whitelist",
    Method = "POST",
    Body = HttpService:JSONEncode({
        whitelistkey = key
    }),
    Headers = {
        ["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
    }
})

if response.StatusCode == 200 then
    local body = HttpService:JSONDecode(response.Body)
    if body.valid then
        print("Whitelisted")
    else
        print("Not whitelisted")
        LPH_CRASH()
    end
else
    print("Server not responding")
    LPH_CRASH()
end
```

## Do NOT send HWIDs manually ‚ùå
Common mistake made by people is retreiving the HWID manually (usually via requesting an http bin) then sending the response value to the server for verification.
<br />
Why you shouldn't do it:
- **The server already sends the HWID of the client on every request** | So there is no need to send it manually.
- **Risk of manipulation** | When you retreive the HWID manually, this can be easily manipulated by the client, which can lead to security issues like having multiple users using the same key.


## `LPH_CRASH` vs `while true do end `

`LPH_CRASH` is a macro provided by Luraph, and is a much safer and more efficient way to exit the environment in case of an error or an unexpected response from the server.
- You can read more about it [here](https://lura.ph/dashboard/documents/macros)

## Testing our script

To test our script, we will have to run our local server and then execute the script.
<br />
```bash
node index.js
```

After running the server, you can execute the script in your executor, and you should see the output in the Roblox console (F9).

# Conclusion

With this, we have successfully set up our script for our whitelist system.
<br/>
In the next part of the guide, we will be adding security measures to our system to prevent whitelist spoofing & attacks. You can check it out [here](/blog/rblx-auth4)
